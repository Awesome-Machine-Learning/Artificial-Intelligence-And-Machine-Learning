It gives computers the skill to learn from previous data without an expert having to program it. With the help of machine learning, a system takes decisions based on previous patterns.\n",

    "### It includes the selection of a model that represents data. ***Decision trees***, instances, set of rules, etc are some examples of this component. A decision tree is a tree-like model comprising of various decisions and their consequences. Instance-based learning occurs when the machine compares new problems with previously occurred instances.\n",
    "## 2. Evaluation\n",
    "### Evaluation is that component which provides the machine to evaluate and optimize hypotheses (candidate programs). It is also known as objective, utility, or scoring function. Some examples of evaluation are accuracy, squared error, posterior probability, etc. Accuracy basically measures or evaluates classification models. Posterior probability is that probability which arises upon taking into account updated information.\n",
